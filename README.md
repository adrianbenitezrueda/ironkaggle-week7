# IronKaggle Competition: Predictive Sales Modeling Challenge

## Overview
Welcome to the IronKaggle Competition, where you’ll apply your Machine Learning expertise to predict sales for various stores. This challenge is designed to test your data science skills in feature engineering, model selection, hyperparameter tuning, and model evaluation—all in a collaborative setting. As your Lead Teacher (LT) and Teaching Assistant (TA) are unavailable, it's up to you and your partner to shine and build the most accurate model possible!

## Dataset
The dataset includes multiple features:
- **Shop ID**: Identifier for each store.
- **Day of the Week**: The day when the sales data was collected.
- **Number of Customers**: Customer count in each store on a specific day.
- **Promotions**: Indicator of whether a promotion was active.
- **Holidays**: Whether the day was a public holiday or not.
- (Additional features can be added if relevant).

The goal is to predict the total sales for each store accurately based on these and other variables.

## Project Structure
- **Data Exploration**: We begin by visualizing and exploring the dataset to understand the relationships between features and the target variable.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and scaling numerical values.
- **Model Development**: We experiment with various models, including linear models and tree-based algorithms.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Utilizing `RandomizedSearchCV` to optimize the parameters of the selected model.
- **Evaluation**: Comparing models using metrics such as MAE, RMSE, and R² to select the best-performing model.

## Installation
To run the project locally, clone the repository and install the necessary packages using:
```bash
git clone [repo_url]
cd [repo_name]
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the Code
To train and evaluate the model, run the following command:
```bash
python train.py
```
Make sure you have the dataset in the appropriate directory as specified in the code.

## Results
After preprocessing and model development, we evaluated multiple models. The RandomForestRegressor was initially selected due to its promising performance. We then refined the model using `RandomizedSearchCV` and retrained it on the entire dataset. The results, based on the test set, were as follows:

### Initial Model: RandomForestRegressor
- **MAE**: 567.46
- **RMSE**: 911.65
- **R²**: 0.9448

### Best Model After Tuning
- **MAE**: 534.43
- **RMSE**: 856.51
- **R²**: 0.9473

As seen, our best model achieved an improvement across all metrics, indicating a more accurate prediction of sales.

## Submission
The predictions generated by the optimized model have been saved to a CSV file (`data/cleaned/sales_predictions.csv`) and are ready for submission. The file follows the competition’s format and includes the store ID and predicted sales for each entry.
